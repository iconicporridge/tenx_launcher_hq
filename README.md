# tenx_launcher_hq

A repository for my python codes to operate a Tenx (M&amp;S) USB foam missile launcher. I'm running elementary os Juno, probably won't work straight off the bat in Windows (because I haven't used os to control filepaths). 

## Dependancies

You'll probably find out when it doesn't work, but python 3.x, pyqt5, and pyusb are the main ones. 

## How to use

Run "command_centre.py" with "python command_centre.py" or your system equivalent (eg. python3). 

## Udev Rules

You might need extra permissions to use a USB device from python. One way is to use sudo, but you might not want your kids to have your password. I've included an example udev rule "99-missile-launcher.rules", which goes in /etc/udev/rules.d on Ubuntu like systems. You'll need to modify the rule to your username etc. place it in the correct directory and restart your computer.

## Windows Problems
Libusb is not a default on windows like it is for most linux systems. Install https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.6.0.exe/ or some other version of libusb.
